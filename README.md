### Environment Variables

name | default | description
-----|---------|------------
`WEBTOKEN_SECRET_KEY` | | Specifies the secret string used to sign any JWTs - should be at least 32 characters, but the longer the better.
`WEBTOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME` | `21600` | Specifies the amount of seconds before any generated JWTs expires.
`DB_URL` | | In order to connect to MongoDB, you will need a URI string (Uniform Resource Identifier) which is similar to a URL.
